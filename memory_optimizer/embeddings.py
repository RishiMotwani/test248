"""Ollama embedding access with a process-wide (endpoint, model, text) -> vector cache.

Design note (brain.md D3/D8): facts are embedded *lazily* on first retrieval, and
the query string is embedded through the same cache so repeated routine queries
cost nothing after the first embedding. All vectors are cached in memory only;
there is no persistence of embeddings across restarts.
